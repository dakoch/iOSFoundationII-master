//  02.0 DAK	November 25, 2014 Final project for iOS F2
//
//  Assignment 1
//  Create a Person class in Swift with the following functionality:
//      Properties for a personâ€™s first name and last name and a bool declaring if the person is a student or not
//      An init method that takes in 3 parameters that are used to set each property on the person.
//      A method that returns the persons full name (the first name and last name combined!)
//
//  Assignment 2
//  In your ViewController class:
//      Add a property called myPerson that is of type Person, the class we made in the first homework.
//      Add a button to your view controller via storyboard.
//      Hook up an @IBAction from the button to your ViewController.Swift file. This will create a
//		 method that will fire every time the user presses on your button.
//      Inside this method, print your myPerson's full name to the console.
//
//  Assignment 3
// 	 Replace whatever interface you have (random labels and button) with a table view.
// 	 This table view should display a list Person object's names.
//
//  Assignment 4
//  Embed your main view controller (the one with the table view) in a navigation controller.
//    Create a 2nd view controller class and name it DetailViewController.
//    Drag out a view controller in storyboard, and set its class to DetailViewController
//    Create a show segue from your table view cell to your detail view controller on your storyboard.
//    Using prepareForSegue(), pass the person they clicked on in the tableview to the detail view controller
//    Show the person's first and last name in separate labels on the detail view controller.
//
//  Assignment 5
//  Replace the UILabels with UITextFields
//    When the user presses the return key, dismiss the keyboard.
//    Use autolayout to layout your detail view controller so that it looks good in both portrait and landscape modes.
//    Add an optional UIImage property to your Person class.
//
//  Assignment 6
//  Implement a UIImagePickerController into your app. Launch via a button press, just like i did in class.
//    Upon the user choosing or taking a photo, set your image view on your detail view controller to show that image
//    Also set the selectedPerson's image property to be the chosen image as well.
//    Drag out a 2nd View Controller from the object library.
//    Add a 2nd button, that fires a segue to a second view controller when pressed.
//
//  Assignment 7
//	Create a custom table view cell with an image view and label
//	Convert your app to use your custom cell instead of a regular uitableviewcell
//	Create a plist with a root array, and fill it with dictionaries, each with a last name and first name key value pairing
//	In code, load and parse through the plist and create a person object for each dictionary. Add
//      each person to your people array so your table view can show these people.

//  Assignment 8
//	Implement persistence into your app. Skip NSUserDefaults for now, use the NSCoding protocol
//		and NSKeyedArchiver/Unarchiver to persist your people array to disk.
// 	Make sure you have all the functionality from the previous assignments as well,
//		this should be a pretty fully functioning app at this point.
